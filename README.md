## Project Purpose

In this assignment you should work on creating a simple chat application using Firebase, the requirements are as follows :

- You are free to use any mobile framework, including iOS, Android or any hybrid framework.
- The app should provide Authentication and Signup using the Firebase email/password authentication.
   - In addition you should implement the forgot password feature by using the Firebase features.
   - The user should be able to signup, login and log out.
- User profile
   - A user profile should include the user first/last name, gender, user profile image, and city.
      - The profile image should also be stored on Firebase File Storage.
      - The user should be able to edit and update their profile information including their profile image.
   - A user should be able to view a list of users in the system and should be able to view the profile information provided by other users.
- Chatrooms:
   - A logged-in user should be able to list the current chatrooms in the system. A user should be able to join a chat room, view the posted messages, and post new messages.
   - A logged-in user should be able to create a new chatroom.
   - In a chatroom, the messages should be displayed, indicating the message text, date/time of the message, name of user, profile image of the user and number of likes.
      - A user could like a message by clicking on a like button displayed by each message.
      - A user could delete messages that he/she created.
   - In a chatroom the user should be able to see the users currently looking at the same chatroom in realtime.
- App UI:
   - You should design the app UI to enable the usable transition between the screens and make it easy for the user to reach the different app screens. Consider using, a side drawer, or Tab Bar.
   - Also consider using Android Jetpack https://developer.android.com/jetpack (Links to an external site.) and Android Material Design components https://material.io/develop/android (Links to an external site.)

#### Submission should include:
- Start by creating an App mockup/wireframe using a wire-framing tool such as.

   - https://marvelapp.com/ (Links to an external site.)
   - https://mockflow.com/ (Links to an external site.)
- The app mockup should be shared online through adobe cloud or other frameworks and should enable the user to walk through the design and interact with components to understand the app flow.
- Create a Github or Bitbucket repo for the assignment.
   - Push your code to the created repo. Should contain all your code.
   - On the same repo create a wiki page describing your design and implementation. The wiki page should describe the data design choices.
- Demo your App and record an app screencast showing the different app features. Your video should be posted on Youtube and a link included in the Github Wiki page. Make sure the YouTube video is public or link only so that it is viewable through the shared link.
